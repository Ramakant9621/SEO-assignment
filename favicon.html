    <h3>Define Favicon and give an illustrative example</h3>

    <p>A favicon, short for "favorite icon," is a small, typically 16x16 pixels square icon associated with a website. It is displayed in the browser's address bar, tabs, bookmarks, and other areas to provide a visual representation of the website. Favicons are used for branding purposes and help users quickly identify and locate a website among their open tabs or bookmarks.</p>

    <!-- Favicon -->
    <link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon">
    <!-- You can also use the following line for multiple sizes of favicon -->
    <!-- <link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico" sizes="16x16" type="image/x-icon"> -->
